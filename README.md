## About
Hello. I'm glad to welcome You in __Python WORKSHOP__ repository. In this repository my recent Python projects (as well as the old ones) are stored. Some of them still needs a little brush up but feel free to browse whatever You want. :eyes:

## Project description
#### :scroll: __Fibonacci Sequence__ _[01_fib]_
A Very easy sample how to program the sequence of the great Fibonacci.

A well known code guessing game. This project have two language options and automatically recognize which one to use based on your locale setup.
If somehow you have never heard of Cows and bulls jump in and try it out. Game have a build in section on "how to play".

#### :computer: __Game of Life__ _[03_gol]_
Have You ever heard about cellular automaton? In short: __cellular automaton__ consist of a regular grid of cells, each cell has its state and neighbourhood. Each automaton
has specific set of rules that defined when the cell can change it's state. This automatons are widely used in many science scenarios so if You want more go to the Wiki page: [Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).

#### :bomb: __Chaos Game__ _[04_cha]
