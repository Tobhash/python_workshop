## About
Hello. I'm glad to welcome You in __Python WORKSHOP__ repository. In this repository my recent and old python projects are stored. Some of them still needs a little brush up but feel free to browse whatever You want. :eyes:

## Project description
:scroll:__Fibonacci Sequence__ _[01_fib]_ - very easy sample how to programm the sequence of the great Fibonacci. 

:cow2:__Cows and Bulls__ _[02_cow]_ - a well known code guessing game. This project have two language options and automaticaly recognize which one to use based on your locale setup.
If somehow you have never heard of Cows and bulls jump in and try it out. Game have a build in section on "how to play".

:computer:__Game of Life__ _[03_gol]_ - :exclamation: WORK STILL IN PROGRESS:exclamation: have You ever heard of cellular automaton? In short: __cellular automaton__ consist of a regular grid of cells, each cell has its state and neighbourhood. Each automaton
has specific set of rules that defined when cell can change state. The automatons have many applications in science so if You are interested in further exploration of the topic, please visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) for a start point.

:bomb:__Chaos Game__ _[04_cha] - :exclamation:WORK STILL IN PROGRESS :exclamation:

:evergreen_tree:__Forest Fire__ _[05_for] - :exclamation: WORK STILL IN PROGRESS :exclamation:

:running:__Fast Keys__ _[06_fas] - :exclamation: WORK STILL IN PROGRESS :exclamation:
