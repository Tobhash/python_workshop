## About
Hello. I'm glad to welcome you in a basic Python3 project's repository.
I will publish here my sample projects created over the years. Some of them were finished quite time ago but never published and some needed a little brush up.

## Projects description

__Cows and Bulls__ _[02_cow]_ - a well known code guessing game. This project have two language options and automaticaly recognize which one to use based on your locale setup.
If somehow you have never heard of Cows and bulls jump in and try it out. Game have a build in section on "how to play".
